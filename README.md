Implemetation of a Dots game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_(game)).

Compile with options -D NN=X, where X is the size of the playing field.

Run with option -p n, where n is 1 if you want to go first, or n is 2 if you want to go after PC, also add -f to see the field.

If you want to look at the tree, use option -d FileName.dot to export the tree in dot file. Example of the tree you can find below.

For help and additional options run with option -h.

To make a move write two letters: first letter represents the raw, second the column, where you want to go (to place a dot in the top left corner write aa).


Here is a tree example for the field 2x2:
